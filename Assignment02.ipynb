How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python\n","\n","Answer:\n","\n","Tuples ensure data integrity in Python through their immutability: once created, their elements cannot be changed. This prevents accidental modifications, leading to more predictable and reliable code. Their fixed nature makes them ideal for representing unchanging data like coordinates or database records. This immutability also allows tuples to be used as dictionary keys, further enhancing their role in maintaining data structure integrity. By guaranteeing a constant state, tuples contribute significantly to robust program design."],"metadata":{"id":"0GCpJ3lMqb1I"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n","Answer:\n","\n","A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.

Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n","Answer:\n","\n","Strings are immutable in Python for efficiency, allowing memory sharing. Their fixed hash value is essential for use as dictionary keys and set elements. Immutability ensures predictability and prevents unintended modifications when strings are passed around in code, enhancing safety. This design choice also simplifies the internal implementation. When a string appears to be modified, a new string object is created, leaving the original unchanged."],"metadata":{"id":"I-jREReDsT3Q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks\n","Answers:\n","\n","Dictionaries offer faster lookups (average O(1)) compared to lists (O(n)) when accessing elements by a unique key.Dictionaries enforce key uniqueness, useful for distinct identifiers. Their flexible structure suits unordered, labeled data, unlike the sequential nature of lists. Average insertion and deletion in dictionaries are also efficient (O(1)), while list operations can be slower. Choose dictionaries for key-based access and labeled data, lists for ordered sequences."],"metadata":{"id":"U61iBeLEs-mo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n","Answer:\n","\n","Consider storing city coordinates (latitude, longitude). A tuple, like (21.1458, 79.0882) for Nagpur, is preferable to a list. Its immutability ensures these fixed values won't be accidentally altered, maintaining data integrity for each city's location. The tuple naturally represents the latitude and longitude as an inseparable, unchanging unit. Furthermore, tuples can serve as dictionary keys if you later need to map coordinates to other city data, a capability lists lack due to their mutability. This choice clearly communicates the intent of fixed geographical data for Nagpur."],"metadata":{"id":"J3_PUauJuBV3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python\n","Answer:\n","\n","Sets in Python are designed to store only unique elements. When you attempt to add a duplicate value to a set, Python automatically ignores it. The set will only ever contain one instance of that particular value.\n","\n","Internally, sets utilize hashing (similar to dictionaries) to efficiently manage their elements and check for duplicates. When you try to add a new element, Python calculates its hash value and checks if an element with the same hash value already exists in the set. If it does and the elements are equal, the new addition is simply not performed"],"metadata":{"id":"IfvsspDI7sE2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ### 14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries\n"," Answer:\n","\n"," The in keyword in Python serves to check for membership within a sequence or collection, but its behavior and efficiency differ significantly between lists and dictionaries due to their underlying structures.\n","\n","- For Lists:\n","\n","When you use in with a list, it performs a linear search. Python iterates through each element of the list sequentially, starting from the beginning, and compares it to the value you're checking for.\n","- For Dictionaries:\n","\n","When you use in with a dictionary, it checks for the presence of the key in the dictionary's keys. Due to the underlying hash table implementation, this check is highly efficient."],"metadata":{"id":"h8PB1yiN8GKa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not\n","Answer:\n","\n","No, you cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in Python once it's created.\n","\n","The reason for this lies in the fundamental property of tuples: immutability. Immutability means that after an object is created, its internal state (the elements it contains) cannot be changed."],"metadata":{"id":"qbbsTCWT9QOD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case\n","Answer:\n","\n","A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where the values associated with some keys are themselves dictionaries.

In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries\n","Answer:\n","\n","Lists are preferred over dictionaries when the order of elements is significant and needs to be maintained. When you primarily access elements by their position (index), lists offer direct and efficient retrieval. If you need to store an ordered sequence that may contain duplicate items, lists are suitable as sets enforce uniqueness and dictionaries focus on unique keys. When you frequently iterate based on the order of elements, lists provide a straightforward approach. For simple collections where key-based lookups are not required, the structure of a list is often more direct. Additionally, for large sequential data of the same type, lists can sometimes be more memory-efficient. Finally, lists naturally represent ordered sequences inherent in certain data or algorithms."],"metadata":{"id":"Bh-9VfOMC4Jx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval\n","Answer:\n","\n","Before Python, dictionaries were unordered; iteration order was unpredictable due to hash table optimization for key lookups, not insertion sequence. Retrieval relied solely on keys, not indices.\n","\n","From Python, insertion order is preserved, making iteration predictable. However, the core purpose remains efficient key-based retrieval (average O(1)). Direct numerical index access isn't supported. Thus, dictionaries prioritize fast lookups via keys over ordered access by position, unlike lists."],"metadata":{"id":"SoXPuMr7HkPk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" ### 20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval\n","Answer:\n","\n","Lists retrieve data based on their ordered position, using an index . To find a specific item, you might need to iterate through the list until you reach the desired index or value .\n","\n","Dictionaries, on the other hand, retrieve data using unique keys. You directly access a value by providing its associated key, similar to looking up a word in a real dictionary. This key-based retrieval is generally much faster on average than searching through a list, especially for large collections, as dictionaries use a technique called hashing for efficient lookups. The order of items in a dictionary reflects insertion order but isn't the primary mechanism for retrieval."],"metadata":{"id":"UAiI5p89Na5-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# PRACTICAL QUESTIONS"],"metadata":{"id":"jFeNOgcIONgk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.
